# Deck Knight: : A Roguelike Card Autobattler
Deck Knight is a strategic roguelike where you build and optimize a deck of powerful cards to dominate the battlefield. Build your ultimate deck, then watch as your tactics unfold in fast-paced, automated combat. Every decision matters, from the cards you add to the upgrades you choose, as you venture deeper into the world.

# Key Features
Strategic Deckbuilding: Start with a small set of cards and build a powerful deck as you progress. Choose from a vast pool of unique cards with effects like damage, healing, shielding, and more.

Permanent Card Progression: The rewards you earn between battles aren't just new cardsâ€”they're permanent buffs to your existing deck. Upgrade your cards' effects to create an unstoppable build.

Auto-Battler Combat: After you've set your deck, your cards take to the battlefield and execute your strategy on their own. The real challenge is in the planning, not the execution.

Persistent Decks: Save your favorite decks and share them with friends. Challenge them in the built-in PvP mode to see whose strategy is best.
